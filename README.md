# Here's a cool animation using JavaScript + HTML5_canvas + CSS3. 

I utilized HTML5 canvas with vanilla JavaScript (no J Query) + some CSS3. JavaScript & Canvas seem to be really hot right now so I thought I would try it out.


Other technologies used were:
An npm library named canvas-confetti authored by [Kirilv.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti),
Node,
Npm,
Webpack,
Babel.
